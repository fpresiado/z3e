## TIER RECOMMENDATION LOGIC

The app should recommend upgrades based on usage:

```typescript
// Recommendation algorithm
if (userUsage.monthlyAiCalls > tier.limit * 0.8) {
  // User at 80%+ of AI call limit
  recommendUpgrade(nextTier);
}

if (userDashboard.frequentlyUsesAnalytics) {
  // Uses analytics multiple times/week
  if (tier === 'Basic') recommendUpgrade('Advanced');
  if (tier === 'Advanced') recommendUpgrade('Premium');
}

if (userFleet.driverCount > tier.maxDrivers) {
  // Too many drivers for tier
  recommendUpgrade(nextTier);
}
```

**Timing:**
- Show recommendation 1x per week (if applicable)
- Not pushy, informational tone
- Include tier comparison
- "Upgrade" button vs "Not now"

---

## FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

### Tier Modifications
- Monitor tier adoption rates
- Adjust pricing quarterly based on AI costs
- Consider special tiers (e.g., "Fleet 10-driver")
- Region-specific pricing (if international expansion)

### Promotional Code Support
- Coupon codes for:
  - Fleet signups
  - Partners / affiliate programs
  - Customer retention
  - Platform-specific campaigns

### Family Plans
- Share subscription across family members
- Each member has own account, shared cost
- Planned for Q2 2026
